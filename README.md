# 📝 Python Quiz Game

A simple command-line multiple-choice quiz built with Python.  
The program asks a set of questions, checks the user’s answers, and provides a final score.

This project is part of my **Python learning journey**, where I practice working with lists, tuples, loops, and conditionals.
